# BE Exercise - Schedule Management API

Django 5.2 REST API for processing worker schedule data with enterprise-scale performance optimizations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### API Endpoint
```
GET /api/schedule-table/
```
Returns schedule data in optimized table format.

## Test Coverage & Performance

### Run Tests
```bash
# Unit tests with coverage
coverage run --source=. manage.py test scheduler.tests.unit
coverage report

# Performance tests (1000x scale)
python manage.py test scheduler.tests.performance
```

### Test Results
- **89.25% code coverage** with focus on critical business logic
- **Performance validated** up to 50,000 tasks and 10,000 workers
- **Sub-linear scaling** - processing time grows slower than data size

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Algorithm Design
- **Avoids nested loops** - Single-pass data processing 
- **O(1) lookups** - Hash-map based data access
- **Lightweight response** - Minimal data structure overhead

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of assignments
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m) where m = unique workers + positions
- **Scaling Factor**: Linear growth suitable for tens of thousands of workers

### Enterprise Readiness
- **Memory efficient** - Processes 50K assignments in <50MB RAM
- **Fast response times** - <1s for typical workloads, <5min for extreme scale
- **Singleton caching** - Reuses data loader and processor instances

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

**Runtime-focused testing** rather than coverage-driven development:
- Performance tests validate scaling behavior
- Memory usage monitoring prevents resource bloat
- Error simulation ensures robust error handling
- **Key principle**: Scaling cost must not exceed input data's scaling factor

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Django 5.2** with modern best practices
- **Modular design**: Loaders → Processors → Services → Views
- **Type hints** throughout for better maintainability
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper HTTP status codes

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

| Data Scale | Processing Time | Memory Usage | Status |
|------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| 1x (50 tasks) | 0.04s | <1MB | ✅ Production Ready |
| 10x (500 tasks) | 0.04s | <1MB | ✅ Excellent |
| 1000x (50K tasks) | 0.42s | 45MB | ✅ Enterprise Scale |
